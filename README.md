## Amazon Elastic Inference

 - Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) is a resource you can attach to your Amazon EC2 CPU instances to accelerate your deep learning (DL) inference workloads. 
 - Amazon EI accelerators come in multiple sizes and are a cost-effective method to build intelligent capabilities into applications running on Amazon EC2 instances.
 - Amazon EI distributes model operations defined by TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, and the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format through MXNet between low-cost, DL inference accelerators and the CPU of the instance.
